## Realtime tracker for MBTA bus #1 in Boston

This program tracks buses on the MBTA #1 route in Boston, MA in real time. Bus #1 travels between Roxbury and Cambridge, stopping at both the MIT and Harvard campuses. Buses appearing in red are travling northbound, while buses that appear in blue are going southbound. The icon color changes once the bus reaches a terminal station and changes direction.

I plan to build upon this model to make more real-time tracking web apps for public transit in Portland, OR and other entities for which I can access real-time location data.
