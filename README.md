## Realtime tracker for MBTA bus #1 in Boston

This program tracks buses on the MBTA #1 route in Boston, MA in real time. Bus #1 travels between Roxbury and Cambridge, stopping at both the MIT and Harvard campuses. Buses appearing in red are travling northbound, while buses that appear in blue are going southbound. The icon color changes once the bus reaches a terminal station and changes direction.

This model can be built upon to make more real-time tracking web apps for public transit in Portland, OR and other entities for which I can access real-time location data through an API.

To use the application: the map is populated and updated automatically upon loading. ''MIT License
